                        A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse 
                        in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.
                         A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though
                          not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs 
                          are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to
                           organize longer prose.
